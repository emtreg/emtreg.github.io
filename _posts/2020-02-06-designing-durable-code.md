title: "Designing Durable Code"

&emsp; Recently, I started reading Sandi Metz's <em>Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby</em> (aka POODR), and it's easy to see why this text is considered a game-changer within the coding community. Although it's impossible to tell exactly what changes an application will undergo in the future, as developers, we have the power to design durable code <em>today</em> in order to reduce the cost of change over time.
