title: "Single Responsibility Principle"

<p>&emsp;In POODR Metz states that ideally, a class should do the smallest possible useful thing. This helps to limit dependencies by ensuring that classes are "reusable, pluggable units of well-defined behavior that have few entanglements."</p>
<!--more-->
<p>&emsp;In order to achieve this, developers should aim to follow the <b>Single Responsiblity Principle</b> (SRP) when designing and creating classes. The goal of this principle is to increase cohesion within classes by ensuring that everything in a class (i.e. its data and behavior) is related to that class's central purpose.</p>

<p>&emsp;Metz recommends two methods for determining if a class has a single responsibility:</p>
<p><b>1. "Interrogate" the class</b></p>
<p>&emsp;This strategy involves rephrasing each method in a class as a question. If it makes sense to pose a resulting question to the class, then that method is likely related to the class's central purpose. For example, in the case of my Minesweeper program the <code><mark>Tile</mark></code> class contains a method that flags a tile. It would therefore make sense to ask the <code><mark>Tile</mark></code> class, <em>"Tile, are you flagged?"</em>. The same, however, could not be said of the <code><mark>Board</mark></code> class (<em>"Board, are you flagged?"</em>).
<p><b>2. Describe the class in one sentence</b></p>
<p>&emsp; If the sentence contains the word 'and' then the class most likely has more than one responsibility. If it contains the word 'or', then it has multiple responsibilities which may not even be related.</p>

<p>Now, let's apply the second method to each of the classes in my Minesweeper program:</p>

<p><b><code><mark>Tile</mark></code>:</b></p>
<p>&emsp;The <code><mark>Tile</mark></code> class <b>updates a tile's symbols in response to the tile being selected/flagged/unflagged</b>.</p>

<p><b><code><mark>Board</mark></code>:</b></p>
<p>&emsp;The <code><mark>Board</mark></code> class <b>populates the gameboard</b>, <b>performs flood-filling</b> and <b>displays the board</b>.</p>

<p><b><code><mark>MineCounter</mark></code>:</b></p>
<p>&emsp;The <code><mark>MineCounter</mark></code> class <b>keeps track of how many mines are left on the board</b> and <b>displays that number to the user</b>.</p>

<p><b><code><mark>Player</mark></code>:</b></p>
<p>&emsp;The <code><mark>Player</mark></code> class <b>allows the player to make a move</b> (i.e. select, flag, unflag a tile).</p>

<p><b><code><mark>Game</mark></code>:</b></p>
<p>&emsp;The <code><mark>Game</mark></code> class <b>carries out the operations of the game until it is won/lost</b>.</p>

<p><b><code><mark>Minesweeper</mark></code>:</b></p>
<p>&emsp;The <code><mark>Minesweeper</mark></code> class <b>begins a new game</b>.</p>

<p>&emsp;After applying this method to each class, it's apparent that both the <code><mark>Board</mark></code> and <code><mark>MineCounter</mark></code> classes have multiple responsibilities. It's important to note, however, that how I choose to address this issue is far from clear-cut. <a class = "link" href="https://deviq.com/single-responsibility-principle/">If a particular class is stable and isnâ€™t causing needless pain as a result of changes, there is little need to change it.</a> It's now up to me to determine if the cost of making further changes to these classes will be worth it in the long run. Now that I am aware of the potential issues with the <code><mark>Board</mark></code> and <code><mark>MineCounter</mark></code> classes, I have decided to keep them intact for the time being so that I may take a closer look at my application's code. If I am able to limit dependencies within these classes by refactoring my code according to Metz's recommendations, then they should become much easier to break down in the future. </p>
