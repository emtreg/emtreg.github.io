<h3>Why Use Agile?</h3>
<p>&emsp;Unlike the increasingly dated waterfall method, agile methodology aims to acknowledge and embrace changes that arise during the software development cycle. This approach values collaboration between the client and development team over contract negotation (which often results in unrealistic expectations and deadlines). Agile follows a model of incremental delivery which ensures that quality, shippable software is routinely delivered to clients.</p>

<h3>The Four Pillars</h3>
<p>&emsp;Agile methodology maintains four key values:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools</li>
  <li>Working software over comprehensive documentation</li>
  <li>Customer collaboration over contract negotiation</li>
  <li>Responding to changes over following a plan</li>
</ol>

<h3>Team Roles</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Product Owner</li>
  <li>Development Team</li>
  <li>Scrum Master</li>
</ol>

<p>Although many subsets of agile exist, the most widely-used practice is <b>Scrum</b>.</p>
